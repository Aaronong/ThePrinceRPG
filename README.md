# ThePrinceRPG



Thank you for trying out ThePrinceRPG. 

This ReadMe contains useful information on how to set the game up and how to play.

The code is a little messy as I made it a while back when I just started coding in Java.

###Set Up
If you do not wish to compile the code, the latest version of the executable .jar file is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3duucJ6dyimeFk5dGs5UGotLWs?usp=sharing)

Simply execute the .jar file to start playing. Ensure that you copy the entire "TheRPG" directory from Google Drive. The two text files, 
1. saveState-NewGame.txt
2. saveState.txt
need to be present in the same directory as the .jar file in order for the game to run without issues.

###Compiling The code
Import the package into eclipse and follow this [guide](http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-37.htm) to create a runnable .jar file.

###How To Play

#####World Mode
The game uses simple and familiar control mechanisms. WASD movement controls, Enter, and Backspace.
